[Mechanic](https://mechanic.design/) is a powerful design toolchain that helps forward-looking organizations move away from a manual design workflow by automating their design operations. Built with love by your friends at [Design Systems International](https://designsystems.international/).

**CURRENT STATUS**: We are working towards a 1.0 release and aim to start inviting beta testers in Q3, 2021

## Get Started

To start using right away and create a new Mechanic project, run the following:

```
$ npm init @designsystemsinternational/mechanic@latest mechanic-project
```

This will build a new base Mechanic project, with one **design function**! Follow the CLI instructions to customize, install and start running.

## Development

To get started, clone this repo.

Then run, `npm run bootstrap`. This will symlink all the dependencies together and run `npm i` inside each package. Running `npm i` inside a package folder will not work.

That should be enough to test certain individual package functionality, but to test mechanic projects with local package versions, we use [`yalc`](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

`npm link` falls short to reproduce package dependencies resolution as projects would by installing from the npm registry. `yalc` can locally publish packages as it would to the npm registry, to then use in local projects.

To do this, first install `yalc` globally.
To publish all packages in the repo, run `npm run publish:local`. To publish an individual package, run `yalc push` from its directory or `yalc push ./packages/[package]`. Run any of these commands when you wish to update the published content.

Then in the project to test the package(s), before installing dependencies run `yalc add [package]` for all packages you wish to test. Then install normally with `npm i`.

For any other needs, check [`yalc's documentation](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

## Publish

Run `npm run publish`
