# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Adds the setting to debounce re-rendering after changing the input values. By default inputs are debounced by 100ms. If a user sets `debounceInputs` in their functions settings to false they can opt-out of the debouncing. The period can be passed in the settings as `debounceDelay` and defaults to 100ms.

### Fixed

- Hash the localStorage key storing a function's params based on the input's config of the function. This makes sure a fresh localStorage key is used if a function's input configuration changes to prevent bugs like #139 from happening.
