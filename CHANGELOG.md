## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0-beta.10] - 2023-02-10

### Added

- Adds public `preload`, `preloadFont` and `memo` utility functions to mechanic core to provide an opt-in performance optimization.

### Fixed

- Fixed extra logged lines when creating DFs through CLI.
- Better localStorage management that detects input changes.
- Serve command now prioritizes argument option for port to use instead of config file. Similar as how dev command works.
- CLI takes new project or function name argument into account when using template or example option.

### Changed

- Holding down shift allows increases the step of the numeric input by 10
- Adds the setting to debounce re-rendering after changing the input values. By default inputs are debounced by 100ms. If a user sets `debounceInputs` in their functions settings to false they can opt-out of the debouncing. The period can be passed in the settings as `debounceDelay` and defaults to 100ms.
